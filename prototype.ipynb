    "# Creating the network of stock market correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a network of stock market correlations, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical stock price data for a selection of stocks over a specific time period. This data can be obtained from financial APIs, stock market databases, or CSV files.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing the stock prices. This step ensures that the data is suitable for analysis.\n",
    "3. **Correlation Calculation**: Compute the correlation matrix for the selected stocks using statistical methods such as Pearson or Spearman correlation. This matrix will represent the relationships between the stocks.\n",
    "4. **Network Construction**: Create a graph where each stock is a node, and edges represent the strength of correlations between stocks. We can use libraries like NetworkX to construct and visualize the network."
